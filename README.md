# App-Review-with-Topic-Modelling
McD App Review Topic Modelling using BERTopic and Top2Vec.

## Problem Urgency
The McDonald's app is a form of online marketing media for ordering and delivering McDonald's menu items. Reviews of an app represent highly valuable data for McDonald's top management as they generate numerous comments—positive, neutral, and negative—regarding the app's performance. With such text data, app reviews are highly valuable for management evaluation concerning aspects that need to be maintained and improved. Therefore, it is necessary to process the data and analyze the topics frequently discussed by app users to obtain meaningful insights and serve as a basis for app improvement evaluation.

## Solution
Using BERTopic and Top2Vec models for Topic Modeling.

## Data  
Daily data from 2019 to 2025 with a total of 9,004 data reviews.

## Research Results
The best performance result in Topic Modeling is the Top2Vec model, which has the highest Coherence Score, indicating a fairly coherent result and that the model can be relied upon to understand technical issues frequently encountered by users. The topic modeling results show that the McD App has concerns related to user difficulties in accessing the application login, complaints about errors and bugs, mixed evaluations of app features, and numerous requests for user assistance in operating the McD application. Recommendations for McD regarding the McD App on the Google Play Store are to improve app stability, particularly in login and transaction features, and to maintain the quality of services and promotions that have already been appreciated by users.
